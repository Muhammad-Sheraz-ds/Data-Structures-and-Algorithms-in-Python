| Criteria         | Linear Search                               | Binary Search                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Method           | Sequential search method.                   | Divide and conquer approach on sorted lists.  |
| Complexity       | Best Case: O(1)                             | Best Case: O(1)                               |
|                  | Worst Case: O(n)                            | Worst Case: O(log n)                          |
| Applicability    | Suitable for small unsorted lists.          | Suitable for sorted arrays.                   |
| Efficiency       | Performs inefficiently for large datasets.  | Extremely efficient for large sorted arrays.   |
