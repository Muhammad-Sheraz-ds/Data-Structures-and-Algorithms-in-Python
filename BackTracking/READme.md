# Backtracking 

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used to find solutions to computational problems, especially those dealing with optimization or decision-making. This approach systematically examines each possible solution to determine if it meets the desired criterion. It works by incrementally building candidates to the solution and abandoning them when they are not feasible, which helps optimize the search for the desired solution.

## How Backtracking Works

The core idea of backtracking is to traverse a decision tree and incrementally build a potential solution. At each step, the algorithm examines whether the current path could lead to the desired solution. If it encounters an obstacle or determines that the current path doesn't align with the problem constraints, it backtracks and tries a different path.

Here's a simple example: solving a Sudoku puzzle using backtracking. The algorithm starts with an empty cell and tries out different numbers. If a number fits the rules, it moves on to the next cell, and if not, it backtracks and tries another number. This process continues until a solution is found.
