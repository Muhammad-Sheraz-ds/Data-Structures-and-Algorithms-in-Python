    "# Lecture 1: Introduction to Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics:**\n",
    "- What is Hashing?\n",
    "- Purpose of Hashing.\n",
    "- Basic Terminology (Hash Function, Hash Table, Collision).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a process of converting input data (or 'keys') into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code or hash value. The goal of hashing is to efficiently index and retrieve data in a hash table. It is widely used in computer science and cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- **Hash Function:** A function that takes an input (or 'key') and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is the hash value.\n",
    "- **Hash Code:** The output of a hash function, representing the unique value associated with the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purposes of hashing are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Retrieval:** Hashing allows for efficient data retrieval by mapping keys to fixed-size hash codes, enabling quick access to corresponding values.\n",
    "2. **Data Integrity:** Hash functions help ensure the integrity of data. Even a small change in the input will result in a substantially different hash code.\n",
    "3. **Security:** Hashing is fundamental in cryptographic applications for creating digital signatures, password storage, and ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function takes an input (or 'key') and produces a fixed-size string of characters, the hash code. The function should be deterministic, meaning the same input will always produce the same output, and it should efficiently compute the hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hash Table\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to hash codes and stores values associated with those keys. It allows for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collision\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash code. Handling collisions is a crucial aspect of designing effective hash functions and hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Collision Resolution Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Chaining:** Each slot in the hash table holds a linked list of elements that hash to the same code.\n",
    "- **Open Addressing:** The algorithm searches for the next available slot in the hash table when a collision occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, hashing is a powerful concept in computer science, providing a mechanism for efficient data retrieval, ensuring data integrity, and playing a crucial role in various applications, including security and cryptography. Understanding the basics of hash functions, hash tables, and collision resolution is fundamental to mastering the concept of hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Hash Function - Simple remainder-based hash function\n",
    "def simple_hash(value, size):\n",
    "    return value % size\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hash Table - Using a dictionary to simulate a hash table\n",
    "hash_table = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample data\n",
    "value_to_hash_1 = 42\n",
    "value_to_hash_2 = 56\n",
    "hash_size = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hashing the values using the simple hash function\n",
    "hashed_value_1 = simple_hash(value_to_hash_1, hash_size)\n",
    "hashed_value_2 = simple_hash(value_to_hash_2, hash_size)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Storing values in the hash table\n",
    "hash_table[hashed_value_1] = \"Data associated with key 1\"\n",
    "hash_table[hashed_value_2] = \"Data associated with key 2\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the results\n",
    "print(\"Hashed Value for Key 1:\", hashed_value_1)\n",
    "print(\"Hashed Value for Key 2:\", hashed_value_2)\n",
    "print(\"Hash Table:\", hash_table)\n"
